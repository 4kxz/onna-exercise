# Backend Exercise

This project contains basic Docker scaffolding for the Onna backend exercise.

The `src` folder contains the Python app.

The makefile provides you three commands `build`, `test` and `run`.

You're free to modify anything in this project if you want to use a different language/library/architecture, as long as you make it easy to run and test your application.
